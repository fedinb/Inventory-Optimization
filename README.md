# Inventory Optimization

Links below lead to scripts related to various Inventory Optimization models and simulations.

The idea of this repository is inspired by [Nicolas Vandeput](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vandeputnicolas/) and [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Inventory-Optimization-Simulations-Nicolas-Vandeput/dp/3110673916). 

* [Safety and Cycle Stock Calculation](https://github.com/fedinb/Inventory-Optimization/blob/main/Safety%20and%20Cycle%20Stock%20Calculation.ipynb)
    - [x] What else has been calculated: average demand, standard deviation, CDF and PPF.
* [Stock Simulation](https://github.com/fedinb/Inventory-Optimization/blob/main/Stock%20Simulation.ipynb)
    - [x] What has been simulated: safety stock, cycle stock, stock in transit, overall stock and demand.
* [Fill Rate Simulation](https://github.com/fedinb/Inventory-Optimization/blob/main/Fill%20Rate.ipynb)
    - [x] What has been simulated: fill rate, cycle service level and period service level.
